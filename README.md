# Dimarcode's Homelab

## Overview

Welcome to my homelab documentation. This space serves as both a **learning environment** and a **practical toolkit**; a place where I experiment with new technologies, document key setups, and build solutions that improve my own workflows.

You'll find notes on everything from server configurations, important how-to guides, and system management practices I've used and refined over time. This lab has been central to building my skills in areas like Linux administration, networking, automation, and troubleshooting, and continues to be an evolving part of my growth in IT.
