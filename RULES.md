# RULES

## Purpose

---
- This doc is created to clearly define what goes in each folder. This makes it easier for me to remember, and will hopefully help readers understand the general layout.

Apps
- Software installed on hosts
- Can be installed locally or containerized

Hardware
- Every piece of hardware
- Specs and role only

Hosts
- VM's, OS, and LXC containers
- Apps running on them
- Basic config information
