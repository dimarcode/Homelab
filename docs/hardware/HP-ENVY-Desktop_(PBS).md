- **Proxmox Backup Server:** Hosts a bare metal installation of PBS, providing dedicated, reliable storage for VM and LXC backups. Running this separately from the main hypervisor increases fault tolerance and keeps backup tasks isolated.

## Integration / Placement

Placed next to a small UPS for surge protection and safe shutdown during outages, and located beside the network rack for direct connectivity to the main switch.
